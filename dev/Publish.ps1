# Publishes the current build to every public channel as ONE action: a GitHub
# release on the public releases repo, then CurseForge, Wago Addons and
# WoWInterface with the same zip, and last the patch notes in Discord #releases.
#
# The logic is shared by every addon: Publish-WowAddon.ps1 in the wow-addon skill's
# scripts directory (its header documents all behaviour and parameters). What is
# specific to ProfessionStations lives in dev/publish.json next to this file: the public
# mirror, the zip checks and the words public patch notes may never contain.
#
# Run from the primary checkout at the published master commit; it publishes, so only
# with the user's go-ahead. Parameters pass straight through: -Repo -Notes -Only
# -CurseId -WagoId -WowiId -Replace -Unlanded -DryRun. WOW_PUBLISHER_SCRIPT, when set,
# names another copy of the shared script (an unlanded change to it, under test).
